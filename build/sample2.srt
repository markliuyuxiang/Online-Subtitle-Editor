1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:06,912
What's up everyone it's part of pulling the lever to continue talk

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,704
Talk about putting yourself out there

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,104
Last episode we talked about social media and online presence in general this month we're taking a closer look at interpersonal relationships in this

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,408
Industry and I'm also going to tell you the second mindset

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,944
The change my dating life forever

6
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,760
People in artist especially

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,808
Crossing reluctant to change their MO

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,392
They think that any kind of marketing is automatically manipulation

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:33,280
It often takes an enormous amount of convincing and motivating to get someone to even start presenting themselves online

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,840
And then there's this phrase I hear all the time

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
I just want to be

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,144
Myself

13
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
Well let's go back to dating

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,008
Because that's where I learned to be very careful with that phrase

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,592
It's easy to dismiss a bad conversation with a girl by saying

16
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:50,176
Well I was just being myself if she didn't like that that's her problem

17
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,016
This went on for a couple of years until I finally started to question this phrase

18
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,808
Was I really being myself

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,160
Or was I a stuttering nervous boring trihard version of myself

20
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,976
Unfortunately for a lot of people being yourself

21
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,048
Means being a kind of s*** version of themselves

22
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,840
For them being yourself means

23
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,912
I shouldn't put any work until I come across to others

24
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,496
Fortunately it is actually really easy to work on your confidence

25
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,824
One of my favorite quotes is leave with your mind and your body will follow

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,128
Speak with your body and your mind will follow

27
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:24,224
Is it scientifically proven connection between our body language and our thoughts

28
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
When you're happy

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
You smile

30
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,064
But it also works the other way around

31
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,344
When you smile

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
To get happy

33
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
It's the same with confidence

34
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696
What kind of plane confidence

35
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
And you will feel

36
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
More confident

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,816
Now quick side note confidence does not mean being a dick

38
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,608
It means believing in yourself

39
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,936
Standing up for your decisions when I consider being a grown up

40
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,520
If you have low self-esteem I recommend you lead with your body

41
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
Work on confidence

42
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Body language

43
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,360
Stand up straight

44
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
Move slowly

45
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,200
Talk slower and lower your pitch

46
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,504
Smile or laugh when it is appropriate

47
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
Not every time you're nervous

48
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
Don't fiddle around

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Take your time

50
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
Q trip

51
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
Just get up

52
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
If you drop something

53
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
Pick it up

54
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
If you walk into the wrong direction

55
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
Just turn around

56
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,656
There's no need to tell everyone that you're an idiot in that stuff like that always happens to you

57
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
Talking to yourself like that is not helping

58
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,264
Everyone drops things

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
Everyone stumbles

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
Just ignore it

61
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
And others will too

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,968
Study the body language of powerful characters like James Bond or Rick Grimes and use it yourself

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
Sooner or later

64
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,088
Information that you're exhibiting confidence will reach your brain and at this point

65
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Things got a lot easier

66
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
Dallas will feel strange at first

67
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,256
It's asking for a lot of self-control and you will overshoot in the beginning

68
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,608
But if you do this long enough you'll also find a balance that feels good

69
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
To you

70
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,960
No one is asking you to become colder shallow or superficial

71
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,056
This is all about increasing your awareness of how you come across as a person

72
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
She will truly be able to be

73
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Yourself
